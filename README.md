# Dimensionality Reduction and Classification in Remote Sensing Images

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This project focuses on applying dimensionality reduction techniques to hyperspectral remote sensing images, followed by classification using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. It uses a novel method called **Kernel Subspace PCA (SubXPCA)** to reduce data dimensionality while retaining important features, resulting in better classification performance and improved model accuracy.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Dimensionality reduction using Kernel Subspace PCA
- Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Web interface built with Flask
- Real-time accuracy prediction on uploaded `.csv` datasets
- Modular architecture with frontend and backend components

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Flask** â€“ Web framework
- **Scikit-learn** â€“ Machine learning
- **Pandas & NumPy** â€“ Data processing
- **HTML/CSS** â€“ Frontend UI

## ðŸ“Š How It Works

1. Upload a `.csv` file containing spectral data (last column should be class labels).
2. Input:
    - Number of principal components to retain
    - Number of nearest neighbors for classification
3. The app:
    - Applies Kernel PCA on feature partitions
    - Re-merges them and applies SubXPCA
    - Trains and tests a KNN classifier
    - Displays the accuracy of classification
